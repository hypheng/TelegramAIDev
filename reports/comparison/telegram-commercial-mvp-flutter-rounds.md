# Telegram Commercial MVP Flutter Round Log

Use this file for per-round `flutter` delivery and acceptance updates for the Telegram commercial MVP slice set.

Each round entry should include:

- timestamp
- framework lane: `flutter`
- work item type and issue reference
- concise working effort or acceptance summary
- total duration
- internal step duration
- token consumption or `not observable`
- validation completed in the round
- parity impact, delivery status change, acceptance outcome, or notable workaround
- AI-efficiency friction summary, or `no confirmed friction in this round`

## 2026-03-22T02:33:08Z

- framework lane: `flutter`
- work item type and issue reference: `requirement`, `issue-1`
- concise working effort summary: Created the Flutter lane app from scratch, copied the canonical shared assets, implemented slice `#1` startup routing/loading/failure/login handoff/placeholder behavior, and added widget validation for route handoff, failure state, and placeholder scope.
- total duration: `16m 34s`
- internal step duration: implementation `15m 40s`, validation `7s`, reporting `18s`
- token consumption: `total=2477199, input=2463139, cached_input=2438784, output=14060, reasoning_output=9210`
- validation completed in the round: `dart format`, `flutter analyze`, and `flutter test` all passed in `apps/flutter_app`
- parity impact, delivery status change, acceptance outcome, or notable workaround: Flutter slice `#1` is now implemented from a clean restart in `apps/flutter_app`, using copied shared design assets and only the minimal startup, login handoff, and authenticated placeholder route structure required by the slice.
- AI-efficiency friction summary: no confirmed AI-efficiency friction in this round

## 2026-03-22T02:43:21Z

- framework lane: `flutter`
- work item type and issue reference: `requirement`, `issue-1-acceptance`
- concise working effort or acceptance summary: Validated the delivered Flutter slice `#1` on Android emulator `emulator-5554`. First launch reached the login handoff cleanly and did not expose any later-slice surface. Acceptance could not fully runtime-trigger the required startup-failure path without altering the shipped build.
- total duration: `5m 45s`
- internal step duration: prep `18s`, runtime `4m 24s`, reporting `13s`
- token consumption: `total=5326232, input=5316499, cached_input=5012864, output=9733, reasoning_output=3967`
- scenarios validated in the round: runtime-verified first launch without session reaching the login handoff; runtime-verified no home shell or chat list surface on launch; could not directly runtime-verify startup failure recovery/notice because the delivered app exposes no acceptance path to induce bundled-asset load failure
- acceptance outcome: `partially verified`
- evidence captured or missing: captured runtime screenshot at `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue1-login.png` and UI dump at `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue1-login.xml`; supporting widget-test evidence exists for the failure state and placeholder scope; missing direct runtime evidence for the startup-failure path and any authenticated placeholder destination because those states were not triggerable from the shipped slice `#1` runtime
- bug issue references created or updated in the round: none
- acceptance gap, parity impact, or notable workaround: merge should remain blocked for full acceptance sign-off because one required slice scenario is not runtime-verifiable through the delivered build. Repo-level acceptance friction was recorded in issue `#16`.
- AI-efficiency friction summary: confirmed repo-level acceptance friction. Flutter slice `#1` lacks a runtime path to trigger the required startup-failure scenario; tracked in issue `#16`

## 2026-03-22T03:14:42Z

- framework lane: `flutter`
- work item type and issue reference: `requirement`, `issue-19-acceptance`
- concise working effort or acceptance summary: Re-ran Flutter acceptance for requirement `#19` / PR `#15` on Android emulator `emulator-5554`. Runtime validation passed both required scenarios: clean no-session first launch to login without later-slice surfaces, and forced startup failure via `flutter run --dart-define=TELEGRAM_DEMO_FORCE_STARTUP_FAILURE=true` showing an explicit recoverable failure without spinner lock.
- total duration: `4m 18s`
- internal step duration: runtime `3m 5s`, reporting `30s`
- token consumption: `total=3589953, input=3581555, cached_input=3423488, output=8398, reasoning_output=2620`
- acceptance outcome: `passed`
- evidence captured or missing: normal launch screenshot `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue19-normal.png`, normal launch UI dump `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue19-normal.xml`, forced failure screenshot `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue19-failure-afterwait.png`, forced failure UI dump `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue19-failure-afterwait.xml`, retry-state screenshot `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue19-failure-retry.png`, retry-state UI dump `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue19-failure-retry.xml`
- bug issue references created or updated in the round: none
- acceptance gap, parity impact, or notable workaround: no remaining acceptance gap for slice `#1` in this rerun. The previously reported runtime-failure-trigger friction is resolved in the current PR.
- AI-efficiency friction summary: no confirmed AI-efficiency friction in this round

## 2026-03-22T03:11:31Z

- framework lane: `flutter`
- work item type and issue reference: `review-fix`, `pr-15 / issue-19`
- concise working effort summary: Added a deterministic non-release startup-failure launch flag for Flutter slice `#1` acceptance, covered it with a widget test, revalidated the app, and updated PR `#15` for re-acceptance.
- total duration: `3m 42s`
- internal step duration: implementation `1m 1s`, validation `26s`, report-update `56s`
- token consumption: `not observable`
- validation completed in the round: `dart format apps/flutter_app/lib/shared/assets/shared_asset_repository.dart apps/flutter_app/test/app_test.dart`, `flutter analyze`, and `flutter test` all passed in `apps/flutter_app`
- parity impact, delivery status change, or notable workaround: Flutter slice `#1` now exposes a deterministic acceptance-safe startup-failure path in non-release builds via `--dart-define=TELEGRAM_DEMO_FORCE_STARTUP_FAILURE=true`, while the default shipped startup behavior remains unchanged.
- AI-efficiency friction summary: no confirmed AI-efficiency friction in this round

## 2026-03-22T03:19:00Z

- framework lane: `flutter`
- work item type and issue reference: `requirement`, `issue-19-acceptance`
- concise working effort or acceptance summary: Re-ran Android emulator acceptance for Flutter requirement `#19` and fully validated both required slice scenarios: clean first launch into the login handoff and explicit startup failure with retry using the acceptance-only dart-define hook.
- total duration: `4m 18s`
- internal step duration: runtime `3m 5s`, reporting `30s`
- token consumption: `total=3589953, input=3581555, cached_input=3423488, output=8398, reasoning_output=2620`
- scenarios validated in the round: runtime-verified no-session launch into the login handoff, runtime-verified forced startup failure with explicit notice and retry control, and runtime-verified no spinner lock during the forced failure scenario
- acceptance outcome: `accepted`
- evidence captured or missing: captured runtime screenshots at `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue19-normal.png`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue19-failure.png`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue19-failure-retry.png`, and `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue19-failure-afterwait.png`, with supporting UI dumps beside each image
- bug issue references created or updated in the round: none
- acceptance gap, parity impact, or notable workaround: the deterministic non-release launch flag closed the prior runtime acceptance gap without changing the default shipped startup behavior, so PR `#15` is now clear to merge for Flutter slice `#1`
- AI-efficiency friction summary: no confirmed AI-efficiency friction in this round
