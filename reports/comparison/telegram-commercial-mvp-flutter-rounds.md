## 2026-03-22T02:33:08Z

- framework lane: `flutter`
- work item type and issue reference: `requirement`, `issue-1`
- concise working effort summary: Created the Flutter lane app from scratch, copied the canonical shared assets, implemented slice `#1` startup routing/loading/failure/login handoff/placeholder behavior, and added widget validation for route handoff, failure state, and placeholder scope.
- total duration: `16m 34s`
- internal step duration: implementation `15m 40s`, validation `7s`, reporting `18s`
- token consumption: `total=2477199, input=2463139, cached_input=2438784, output=14060, reasoning_output=9210`
- validation completed in the round: `dart format`, `flutter analyze`, and `flutter test` all passed in `apps/flutter_app`
- parity impact, delivery status change, acceptance outcome, or notable workaround: Flutter slice `#1` is now implemented from a clean restart in `apps/flutter_app`, using copied shared design assets and only the minimal startup, login handoff, and authenticated placeholder route structure required by the slice.
- AI-efficiency friction summary: no confirmed AI-efficiency friction in this round

## 2026-03-22T02:43:21Z

- framework lane: `flutter`
- work item type and issue reference: `requirement`, `issue-1-acceptance`
- concise working effort or acceptance summary: Validated the delivered Flutter slice `#1` on Android emulator `emulator-5554`. First launch reached the login handoff cleanly and did not expose any later-slice surface. Acceptance could not fully runtime-trigger the required startup-failure path without altering the shipped build.
- total duration: `5m 45s`
- internal step duration: prep `18s`, runtime `4m 24s`, reporting `13s`
- token consumption: `total=5326232, input=5316499, cached_input=5012864, output=9733, reasoning_output=3967`
- scenarios validated in the round: runtime-verified first launch without session reaching the login handoff; runtime-verified no home shell or chat list surface on launch; could not directly runtime-verify startup failure recovery/notice because the delivered app exposes no acceptance path to induce bundled-asset load failure
- acceptance outcome: `partially verified`
- evidence captured or missing: captured runtime screenshot at `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue1-login.png` and UI dump at `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue1-login.xml`; supporting widget-test evidence exists for the failure state and placeholder scope; missing direct runtime evidence for the startup-failure path and any authenticated placeholder destination because those states were not triggerable from the shipped slice `#1` runtime
- bug issue references created or updated in the round: none
- acceptance gap, parity impact, or notable workaround: merge should remain blocked for full acceptance sign-off because one required slice scenario is not runtime-verifiable through the delivered build. Repo-level acceptance friction was recorded in issue `#16`.
- AI-efficiency friction summary: confirmed repo-level acceptance friction. Flutter slice `#1` lacks a runtime path to trigger the required startup-failure scenario; tracked in issue `#16`

## 2026-03-22T03:14:42Z

- framework lane: `flutter`
- work item type and issue reference: `requirement`, `issue-19-acceptance`
- concise working effort or acceptance summary: Re-ran Flutter acceptance for requirement `#19` / PR `#15` on Android emulator `emulator-5554`. Runtime validation passed both required scenarios: clean no-session first launch to login without later-slice surfaces, and forced startup failure via `flutter run --dart-define=TELEGRAM_DEMO_FORCE_STARTUP_FAILURE=true` showing an explicit recoverable failure without spinner lock.
- total duration: `4m 18s`
- internal step duration: runtime `3m 5s`, reporting `30s`
- token consumption: `total=3589953, input=3581555, cached_input=3423488, output=8398, reasoning_output=2620`
- acceptance outcome: `passed`
- evidence captured or missing: normal launch screenshot `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue19-normal.png`, normal launch UI dump `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue19-normal.xml`, forced failure screenshot `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue19-failure-afterwait.png`, forced failure UI dump `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue19-failure-afterwait.xml`, retry-state screenshot `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue19-failure-retry.png`, retry-state UI dump `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue19-failure-retry.xml`
- bug issue references created or updated in the round: none
- acceptance gap, parity impact, or notable workaround: no remaining acceptance gap for slice `#1` in this rerun. The previously reported runtime-failure-trigger friction is resolved in the current PR.
- AI-efficiency friction summary: no confirmed AI-efficiency friction in this round

## 2026-03-22T03:11:31Z

- framework lane: `flutter`
- work item type and issue reference: `review-fix`, `pr-15 / issue-19`
- concise working effort summary: Added a deterministic non-release startup-failure launch flag for Flutter slice `#1` acceptance, covered it with a widget test, revalidated the app, and updated PR `#15` for re-acceptance.
- total duration: `3m 42s`
- internal step duration: implementation `1m 1s`, validation `26s`, report-update `56s`
- token consumption: `not observable`
- validation completed in the round: `dart format apps/flutter_app/lib/shared/assets/shared_asset_repository.dart apps/flutter_app/test/app_test.dart`, `flutter analyze`, and `flutter test` all passed in `apps/flutter_app`
- parity impact, delivery status change, or notable workaround: Flutter slice `#1` now exposes a deterministic acceptance-safe startup-failure path in non-release builds via `--dart-define=TELEGRAM_DEMO_FORCE_STARTUP_FAILURE=true`, while the default shipped startup behavior remains unchanged.
- AI-efficiency friction summary: no confirmed AI-efficiency friction in this round

## 2026-03-22T03:19:00Z

- framework lane: `flutter`
- work item type and issue reference: `requirement`, `issue-19-acceptance`
- concise working effort or acceptance summary: Re-ran Android emulator acceptance for Flutter requirement `#19` and fully validated both required slice scenarios: clean first launch into the login handoff and explicit startup failure with retry using the acceptance-only dart-define hook.
- total duration: `4m 18s`
- internal step duration: runtime `3m 5s`, reporting `30s`
- token consumption: `total=3589953, input=3581555, cached_input=3423488, output=8398, reasoning_output=2620`
- scenarios validated in the round: runtime-verified no-session launch into the login handoff, runtime-verified forced startup failure with explicit notice and retry control, and runtime-verified no spinner lock during the forced failure scenario
- acceptance outcome: `accepted`
- evidence captured or missing: captured runtime screenshots at `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue19-normal.png`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue19-failure.png`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue19-failure-retry.png`, and `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-1/.cache/android-acceptance/issue19-failure-afterwait.png`, with supporting UI dumps beside each image
- bug issue references created or updated in the round: none
- acceptance gap, parity impact, or notable workaround: the deterministic non-release launch flag closed the prior runtime acceptance gap without changing the default shipped startup behavior, so PR `#15` is now clear to merge for Flutter slice `#1`
- AI-efficiency friction summary: no confirmed AI-efficiency friction in this round

## 2026-03-22T03:28:49Z

- framework lane: `flutter`
- work item type and issue reference: `requirement`, `issue-22`
- concise working effort summary: Implemented Flutter slice `#2` demo login flow on top of slice `#1`, including canonical phone entry UI, inline validation feedback, local-only verification state, and authenticated handoff into the existing placeholder route instead of a real home shell.
- total duration: `5m 31s`
- internal step duration: understanding `1m 41s`, implementation `3m 30s`, validation `0s`, report-update `11s`
- token consumption: `not observable`
- validation completed in the round: `dart format` on changed Flutter files, `flutter analyze`, and `flutter test` all passed in `apps/flutter_app`
- parity impact, delivery status change, or notable workaround: Flutter slice `#2` now exposes the demo login flow required by issue `#22` while intentionally keeping the successful handoff on the authenticated placeholder from slice `#1`; no session persistence, restore, home shell, or chat list was added.
- AI-efficiency friction summary: no confirmed AI-efficiency friction in this round

## 2026-03-22T03:39:47Z

- framework lane: `flutter`
- work item type and issue reference: `requirement`, `issue-22-acceptance`
- concise working effort or acceptance summary: Ran post-merge Android emulator acceptance for Flutter requirement `#22`. Verified the login surface and invalid-input feedback at runtime, but the shared Android acceptance typing path only entered a partial value into the Flutter phone field during the valid-login scenario, blocking runtime verification of the placeholder handoff.
- total duration: `7m 47s`
- internal step duration: prep `17s`, runtime `5m 29s`, reporting `1m 13s`
- token consumption: `not observable`
- scenarios validated in the round: runtime-verified login screen with phone field and primary continue CTA; runtime-verified invalid or incomplete input feedback showing `Enter a valid demo phone number to continue.`; attempted digits-only valid login path with `14155550199`, but the field only reflected `141` before tapping continue
- acceptance outcome: `partially verified`
- evidence captured or missing: captured runtime screenshots/UI dumps at `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/TelegramAIDev/.cache/android-acceptance/issue22-login.png`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/TelegramAIDev/.cache/android-acceptance/issue22-login.xml`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/TelegramAIDev/.cache/android-acceptance/issue22-invalid-feedback.png`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/TelegramAIDev/.cache/android-acceptance/issue22-invalid-feedback.xml`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/TelegramAIDev/.cache/android-acceptance/issue22-digits-entered.png`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/TelegramAIDev/.cache/android-acceptance/issue22-digits-entered.xml`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/TelegramAIDev/.cache/android-acceptance/issue22-after-digits-continue.png`, and `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/TelegramAIDev/.cache/android-acceptance/issue22-after-digits-continue.xml`
- bug issue references created or updated in the round: none
- acceptance gap, parity impact, or notable workaround: this round did not confirm a Flutter product bug. The remaining gap is a shared Android acceptance tooling block: `python3 .agents/skills/android-emulator-acceptance/scripts/android_acceptance.py type --value 14155550199` only populated `141` in the Flutter `EditText`, so the accepted login success path could not be completed with confidence.
- AI-efficiency friction summary: confirmed shared acceptance-tooling friction, tracked in issue `#36`

## 2026-03-22T08:42:52Z

- framework lane: `flutter`
- work item type and issue reference: `requirement`, `issue-22-acceptance-rerun`
- concise working effort or acceptance summary: Re-ran the previously blocked Flutter requirement `#22` valid-login scenario on merged `main` after patching the shared Android acceptance helper to send digits-only input through per-digit keyevents. The rerun fully validated the successful login handoff into the authenticated placeholder.
- total duration: `2m 23s`
- internal step duration: prep `6s`, runtime `1m 28s`, reporting `26s`
- token consumption: `total=1471443, input=1468092, cached_input=1321600, output=3351, reasoning_output=1387`
- scenarios validated in the round: runtime-verified valid digits-only phone entry with `14155550199`, runtime-verified tapping `Continue`, and runtime-verified the authenticated placeholder handoff on the merged Flutter app
- acceptance outcome: `accepted`
- evidence captured or missing: captured fresh rerun evidence at `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/TelegramAIDev/.cache/android-acceptance/issue22-success.png` and `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/TelegramAIDev/.cache/android-acceptance/issue22-success.xml`, with additional confirmation from the connected Flutter widget tree reaching `AuthenticatedPlaceholderScreen`
- bug issue references created or updated in the round: none
- acceptance gap, parity impact, or notable workaround: the local shared acceptance-tooling patch removed the text-entry blocker that had weakened the earlier post-merge acceptance round, so Flutter slice `#22` is now fully accepted
- AI-efficiency friction summary: the repo-level tooling friction in issue `#36` is fixed locally and validated by this rerun; keep the issue open until the tooling patch is committed and shared

## 2026-03-22T03:54:57Z

- framework lane: `flutter`
- work item type and issue reference: `requirement`, `issue-25`
- concise working effort summary: Implemented Flutter slice `#3` local demo-session persistence and restore on top of merged slices `#1` and `#2`, storing a valid local demo session after successful login, restoring valid sessions on relaunch into the authenticated placeholder, and clearing invalid stored sessions back to the login handoff.
- total duration: `6m 54s`
- internal step duration: understanding `28s`, implementation `4m 7s`, validation `7s`, reporting `13s`
- token consumption: `total=3643435, input=3628584, cached_input=3385216, output=14851, reasoning_output=3200`
- validation completed in the round: `dart format .`, `flutter analyze`, and `flutter test` all passed in `apps/flutter_app`
- parity impact, delivery status change, or notable workaround: Flutter slice `#3` now persists only the local demo phone-number session needed for the MVP comparison flow and restores it directly to the existing authenticated placeholder; missing or invalid local session state falls back cleanly to the login route without introducing the real home shell, chat list, chat detail, or composer.
- AI-efficiency friction summary: no confirmed AI-efficiency friction in this round

## 2026-03-22T09:11:22Z

- framework lane: `flutter`
- work item type and issue reference: `requirement`, `issue-25-acceptance`
- concise working effort or acceptance summary: Accepted Flutter requirement `#25` on Android emulator `emulator-5554` by runtime-validating the clean missing-session login fallback, a persisted valid demo session restoring directly into the authenticated placeholder on relaunch, and an intentionally corrupted stored session falling back to the login handoff without exposing a real home shell or chat list.
- total duration: `5m 59s`
- internal step duration: prep `29s`, runtime `5m 4s`, reporting `19s`
- token consumption: `total=3823601, input=3816237, cached_input=3795456, output=7364, reasoning_output=3132`
- scenarios validated in the round: runtime-verified initial missing-session launch reaching the login handoff; runtime-verified successful demo login persisting the local session and reaching the authenticated placeholder; runtime-verified relaunch with a valid stored session restoring directly to the authenticated placeholder; runtime-verified an intentionally invalid stored session value falling back to the login handoff instead of any real home shell or chat list
- acceptance outcome: `accepted`
- evidence captured or missing: captured runtime evidence at `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-3/.cache/android-acceptance/issue25-initial.png`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-3/.cache/android-acceptance/issue25-initial.xml`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-3/.cache/android-acceptance/issue25-login-success.png`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-3/.cache/android-acceptance/issue25-login-success.xml`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-3/.cache/android-acceptance/issue25-restored.png`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-3/.cache/android-acceptance/issue25-restored.xml`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-3/.cache/android-acceptance/issue25-invalid-session-prefs.xml`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-3/.cache/android-acceptance/issue25-invalid-fallback.png`, and `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-3/.cache/android-acceptance/issue25-invalid-fallback.xml`, with supporting Flutter widget-tree confirmation for both placeholder and login states
- bug issue references created or updated in the round: none
- acceptance gap, parity impact, or notable workaround: the slice now satisfies the required session-restore behavior while intentionally keeping the authenticated destination on the placeholder surface from slice `#2`; no later-slice home shell or chat list behavior was pulled forward
- AI-efficiency friction summary: no confirmed AI-efficiency friction in this round

## 2026-03-22T09:28:36Z

- framework lane: `flutter`
- work item type and issue reference: `requirement`, `issue-28`
- concise working effort summary: Implemented Flutter slice `#4` home shell and chat list on top of slices `#1` through `#3`, routing successful login and session restore into the real home shell with the `Chats` tab active, rendering the shared chat-list rows and tab metadata from the copied shared assets, and keeping `Contacts` and `Settings` as intentional placeholder tabs.
- total duration: `9m 2s`
- internal step duration: understanding `6m 58s`, implementation `58s`, validation `0s`, reporting `10s`
- token consumption: `total=3309441, input=3281270, cached_input=3168640, output=28171, reasoning_output=11157`
- validation completed in the round: `dart format lib test`, `flutter analyze`, and `flutter test` all passed in `apps/flutter_app`
- parity impact, delivery status change, or notable workaround: Flutter slice `#4` now exposes the real home shell with visible `Chats`, `Contacts`, and `Settings` tabs, a populated shared mock chat list with unread/pinned/muted cues, and explicit loading/empty/error state coverage without pulling forward chat detail, composer, or local send behavior.
- AI-efficiency friction summary: no confirmed AI-efficiency friction in this round

## 2026-03-22T09:36:42Z

- framework lane: `flutter`
- work item type and issue reference: `requirement`, `issue-28-acceptance`
- concise working effort or acceptance summary: Accepted Flutter requirement `#28` on Android emulator `emulator-5554` by runtime-validating the login and restore handoff into the real home shell with `Chats` active, the visible `Chats`/`Contacts`/`Settings` tab shell, stable chat-list behavior, an intentional placeholder destination, and the absence of early chat-detail or composer navigation in slice `#4`.
- total duration: `5m 41s`
- internal step duration: prep `48s`, runtime `4m 31s`, reporting `16s`
- token consumption: `total=6143781, input=6135755, cached_input=6096768, output=8026, reasoning_output=2579`
- scenarios validated in the round: runtime-verified clean login with `14155550199` reaching the real home shell and populated `Chats` list; runtime-verified relaunch with the stored local session restoring directly to the same home shell; runtime-verified visible `Chats`, `Contacts`, and `Settings` tabs; runtime-verified `Settings` opening an intentional placeholder surface; runtime-verified tapping a chat row does not navigate to chat detail or expose any composer or local-send surface; runtime-verified swipe interaction leaves the chat list stable
- acceptance outcome: `accepted`
- evidence captured or missing: captured runtime evidence at `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-4/.cache/android-acceptance/issue28-initial.png`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-4/.cache/android-acceptance/issue28-initial.xml`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-4/.cache/android-acceptance/issue28-filled.xml`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-4/.cache/android-acceptance/issue28-home.png`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-4/.cache/android-acceptance/issue28-home.xml`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-4/.cache/android-acceptance/issue28-restored.png`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-4/.cache/android-acceptance/issue28-restored.xml`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-4/.cache/android-acceptance/issue28-settings.png`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-4/.cache/android-acceptance/issue28-settings.xml`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-4/.cache/android-acceptance/issue28-after-row-tap.png`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-4/.cache/android-acceptance/issue28-after-row-tap.xml`, and `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-4/.cache/android-acceptance/issue28-after-swipe.png`, `/Users/haifengsong/code-base/telegram/worktrees/flutter-issue-4/.cache/android-acceptance/issue28-after-swipe.xml`, with supporting Flutter widget-tree confirmation for `HomeShellScreen`, `ChatListScreen`, and `HomeTabPlaceholderScreen`
