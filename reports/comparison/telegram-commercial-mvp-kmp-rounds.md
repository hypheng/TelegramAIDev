- timestamp
- framework lane: `KMP`
- work item type and issue reference
- concise working effort or acceptance summary

- AI-efficiency friction summary, or `no confirmed friction in this round`

## 2026-03-22T10:13:43Z — KMP requirement issue-18

- framework lane: `KMP`
- work item type and issue reference: `requirement`, `issue-18`
- concise working effort summary: Bootstrapped the `apps/kmp` Compose Multiplatform project, copied the slice-1 shared assets into app-local resources, implemented the startup loading gate, login handoff, startup failure notice, and authenticated placeholder routing stub, and opened PR `#41` for merge.
- total duration: `21m 34s`
- internal step duration:
  - `read-artifacts`: `22s`
  - `kmp-docs-and-inspect`: `1m 42s`
  - `implementation`: `17m 4s`
  - `report-and-pr`: `1m 55s`
- token consumption: `total=4079613, input=4045387, cached_input=3971584, output=34226, reasoning_output=19922`
- validation completed in the round: `cd apps/kmp && ./gradlew --no-daemon :composeApp:testDebugUnitTest :composeApp:assembleDebug` ✅
- parity impact, delivery status change, or notable workaround: KMP slice `#1` now has a comparable startup shell with a shared-asset-backed login handoff and a clearly non-home authenticated placeholder stub; startup failure currently uses the shared notice path rather than a custom retry label to avoid inventing non-canonical copy.
- AI-efficiency friction summary: `no confirmed AI-efficiency friction in this round`

## 2026-03-22T10:17:01Z — KMP requirement issue-18 acceptance

- framework lane: `KMP`
- work item type and issue reference: `requirement`, `issue-18`
- scenarios validated in the round:
  - first launch without session reaches login cleanly
  - startup failure does not leave the app stuck on a spinner
  - any authenticated destination reachable in this slice is clearly a placeholder, not a later-slice implementation
- acceptance outcome: `failed`
- concise working effort summary: Built and deployed the merged `origin/main` KMP app from `apps/kmp`, cleared app state on Android emulator `Pixel_3a_API_34_Local`, validated startup on merged commit `5ea9095`, captured startup crash evidence, and filed bug `#42` when the app failed before login.
- total duration: `4m 39s`
- internal step duration:
  - `artifact-read`: `28s`
  - `deploy-setup`: `1m 21s`
  - `runtime-validation`: `1m 58s`
  - `report-closeout`: `28s`
- token consumption: `total=1777109, input=1768291, cached_input=1695360, output=8818, reasoning_output=2799`
- evidence captured or missing:
  - captured: `.cache/android-acceptance/req18/home-before-relaunch.png`
  - captured: `.cache/android-acceptance/req18/post-launch-crash.png`
  - captured: `.cache/android-acceptance/req18/post-launch-crash-ui.xml`
  - captured: `.cache/android-acceptance/req18/startup-crash-logcat.txt`
  - missing: runtime evidence for the authenticated placeholder, because startup crash blocked navigation beyond app launch
- bug issue references created or updated in the round:
  - `#42` — [Bug][KMP][Req #1] App crashes before login on Android startup
- acceptance gap, parity impact, or notable workaround: Slice `#1` is not acceptance-ready on merged main because the app crashes in `MaterialTheme` before showing the login flow; startup-failure and placeholder expectations remain blocked behind that crash, so KMP is currently behind the intended slice parity for this requirement.
- AI-efficiency friction summary: `no confirmed AI-efficiency friction in this round`

## 2026-03-22T10:24:18Z — KMP bug-fix issue-42

- framework lane: `KMP`
- work item type and issue reference: `bug-fix`, `issue-42`
- concise working effort summary: Fixed the startup crash from issue `#42` by converting shared hex color tokens into channel-based Compose `Color` instances instead of raw packed `ULong` values, added regression coverage for Material color copying, and revalidated the KMP debug unit tests plus debug APK build.
- total duration: `3m 57s`
- internal step duration:
  - `context-gathering`: `1m 25s`
  - `implementation`: `30s`
  - `validation`: `49s`
  - `report-closeout`: `12s`
- token consumption: `total=1734956, input=1726832, cached_input=1687168, output=8124, reasoning_output=3707`
- validation completed in the round: `cd apps/kmp && ./gradlew --no-daemon :composeApp:testDebugUnitTest :composeApp:assembleDebug` ✅
- parity impact, delivery status change, or notable workaround: KMP slice `#1` no longer feeds invalid Compose color-space bits into `MaterialTheme` during startup, so the shared-token theme path should now stay aligned with the intended login-first startup routing instead of crashing before the unauthenticated handoff.
- AI-efficiency friction summary: `no confirmed AI-efficiency friction in this round`

## 2026-03-22T10:31:55Z — KMP requirement issue-18 re-acceptance

- framework lane: `KMP`
- work item type and issue reference: `requirement`, `issue-18`
- scenarios validated in the round:
  - first launch without session reaches login cleanly
  - startup failure does not leave the app stuck on a spinner
  - any authenticated destination reachable in this slice is clearly a placeholder, not a later-slice implementation
- acceptance outcome: `blocked`
- concise working effort or acceptance summary: Re-ran merged-main acceptance for KMP requirement `#18` after bug-fix PR `#44`. Confirmed `origin/main` at commit `9511ba8` includes the startup-crash fix from PR `#44`, rebuilt `apps/kmp`, cleared app state on Android emulator `Pixel_3a_API_34_Local`, and runtime-verified clean first launch into the login surface with no startup crash and no later-slice home-shell UI.
- total duration: `5m 26s`
- internal step duration:
  - `acceptance-prep`: `34s`
  - `runtime-validation`: `3m 26s`
  - `friction-check`: `37s`
  - `report-update`: `22s`
- token consumption: `total=2886313, input=2874494, cached_input=2764672, output=11819, reasoning_output=5140`
- evidence captured or missing:
  - captured: `.cache/android-acceptance/req18-reaccept/login.png`
  - captured: `.cache/android-acceptance/req18-reaccept/login-ui.xml`
  - captured: `.cache/android-acceptance/req18-reaccept/post-tap.png`
  - captured: `.cache/android-acceptance/req18-reaccept/post-tap-ui.xml`
  - captured: `.cache/android-acceptance/req18-reaccept/logcat-tail.txt`
  - missing: direct runtime evidence for the startup-failure branch, because the delivered KMP build still exposes no deterministic acceptance path to force `StartupFailureScreen`
- bug issue references created or updated in the round:
  - none
- acceptance gap, parity impact, or notable workaround: Bug `#42` is fixed and the slice now launches cleanly to login, but full requirement-`#18` sign-off remains blocked because the required startup-failure scenario is still not runtime-triggerable on merged main. No authenticated placeholder or later-slice home shell became reachable in this rerun; the visible surface remained the intended login-only slice.
- AI-efficiency friction summary: confirmed repo-level acceptance friction. KMP slice `#1` still lacks a runtime trigger for the required startup-failure scenario; tracked in issue `#45`

## 2026-03-22T10:39:43Z — KMP bug-fix issue-45

- framework lane: `KMP`
- work item type and issue reference: `bug-fix`, `issue-45`
- concise working effort summary: Added a debug-only Android launch-intent hook for KMP slice `#1` startup-failure acceptance, kept the default no-session launch routing unchanged, covered the normal and forced-failure bootstrap paths with unit tests, and opened PR `#46` to close issue `#45`.
- total duration: `6m 56s`
- internal step duration:
  - `context-and-grounding`: `1m 36s`
  - `implementation`: `2m 5s`
  - `validation`: `1m 28s`
  - `report-and-pr`: `1m 32s`
- token consumption: `total=2273043, input=2257309, cached_input=2210944, output=15734, reasoning_output=6851`
- validation completed in the round:
  - `cd apps/kmp && ./gradlew --no-daemon :composeApp:testDebugUnitTest :composeApp:assembleDebug` ✅
- parity impact, delivery status change, or notable workaround: KMP slice `#1` now exposes a deterministic non-production startup-failure path from the shipped debug APK via `adb shell am start -n com.hypheng.telegram.kmp/.MainActivity --es startup_debug_hook force_failure`, while default first launch without the extra still routes cleanly to login. This unblocks runtime verification of the required failure-state branch for requirement `#18` without adding a user-visible setting or release-only behavior.
- AI-efficiency friction summary: `no confirmed AI-efficiency friction in this round`
